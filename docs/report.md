## 1. Executive Summary

Mobile Financial Services (MFS) in Bangladesh have achieved unprecedented reach, boasting over 237 million registered accounts as of December 2024. However, according to Bangladesh Bank and industry surveys, only **37.6% of registered accounts are active**, and over **42.5% of users transact only once or twice a month**. 

When a customer stops transacting, MFS providers like upay rely on a singular, blunt diagnostic heuristic: **three consecutive silent weeks triggers a generic broadcast SMS**. This treats dormancy as a homogeneous condition, burning marketing budget while irritating users.

**WhyQuiet (Cause Desk)** re-architects dormant wallet management from indiscriminate mass broadcasting to **precision diagnosis and governance**:
- **Five-Cause Diagnostic Taxonomy**: Differentiates between *Job Exit*, *Migration*, *Solved Problem*, *Fee Shock*, and *Supply-Side Failure* using 20 mathematical features extracted from the 26-week historical transaction decline shape.
- **Calibrated Refusal Mechanism**: Unlike traditional models forced to guess, WhyQuiet incorporates calibrated refusal thresholds ($\tau=0.80, \delta=0.10$). When transaction signals are noisy or ambiguous, it outputs *"No attributable cause. I will not spend your money here."*
- **Two-Person Governance & Audit Integrity**: Integrates a maker-checker approval workflow (`proposer != approver`) enforced by PostgreSQL triggers and an append-only audit log.
- **Economic Sensitivity Simulation**: Evaluates net economic recovery across 1%, 4%, and 8% user recovery rates, comparing the WhyQuiet model against both the rule baseline and an oracle upper bound.
- **Rigorous Distribution-Shift Validation**: Trained strictly on Population A (4,800 train) and evaluated on an unseen, heavily shifted Population B (3,000 wallets), achieving a **Headline Population B Macro-F1 of 0.8636** with a **21.73% calibrated refusal rate**.

## 2. Problem Statement & The "Five Diseases"

### 2.1 The Single Thermometer Failure Mode
The industry standard heuristic (*"weeks silent &ge; 3 &rarr; send reactivation message"*) fails because it misinterprets silence. A wallet going quiet is not a single symptom; it is five fundamentally distinct underlying behavioral disruptions:

```
                          ┌──────────────────────────┐
                          │ 3 Weeks Silent in Ledger │
                          └─────────────┬────────────┘
                                        │

```

1. **Job Exit (Payroll Discontinuation)**:
   - *Behavior*: Regular, bi-weekly or monthly salary inflows abruptly stop; subsequent cash-out transactions cease entirely.
   - *Targeted Remedy*: Pause proactive outreach; send an onboarding guide to re-link the wallet when starting a new job.
2. **Migration (Geographic Relocation)**:
   - *Behavior*: Transaction volume drops, app login geolocation shifts, and transactions at previous neighborhood agent counters drop to zero.
   - *Targeted Remedy*: Location-aware SMS routing user to verified agent points and merchants in their new district.
3. **Solved Problem (Completed Lifecycle)**:
   - *Behavior*: A burst of high-value transactions for a specific purpose (e.g. tuition fee payment, medical relief remittance, festival transfer), followed by natural dormancy.
   - *Targeted Remedy*: **No action ($0 BDT spend)**. Avoids wasting marketing budget or spamming satisfied single-purpose users.
4. **Fee Shock (Tariff Sensitivity)**:
   - *Behavior*: User experiences a higher-tier cash-out fee or tariff change; transaction count immediately plummets while balance is drawn down.
   - *Targeted Remedy*: Subsidized cash-out fee waiver voucher on the next 2 transactions.
5. **Supply-Side Failure (Agent Counter Liquidity Depletion)**:
   - *Behavior*: A cluster of failed cash-out attempts within 2–4 weeks due to agent float shortages or network timeouts, followed by abandonment.
   - *Targeted Remedy*: Field operations alert to replenish local agent cash float; automated SMS routing user to nearby high-float agent counters.

## 3. Mandatory Honesty Line & Distribution Shift Design

Per project specifications (AMENDMENTS A1 & A3):

> *"Real ledgers contain no cause label. We train a multi-cause classifier on SIMULATED causes (population A) and evaluate it on a SHIFTED population B it has never seen. We claim robustness to distribution shift in simulation, not real-world accuracy."*

> *"The causes are simulated. What we show is that attribution survives a population the model never saw and that it refuses when the shape is ambiguous. Whether real causes look like ours is exactly what real upay data would answer first."*

### Distribution Shift: Population A vs Population B
To ensure the machine learning pipeline does not merely memorize simulator artifacts, **Population B (3,000 wallets)** was generated with extensive multi-axis shifts relative to **Population A (6,000 wallets)**:

| Dimension | Population A (Training Domain) | Population B (Shifted Eval Domain) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pay Cycle Mix** | Weekly: 35%, Biweekly: 25%, Monthly: 40% | Weekly: 20%, Biweekly: 20%, Monthly: 60% |
| **Cause Prior Distribution** | Equal across 5 causes (20% each) | Skewed: Job Exit (25%), Solved (15%), Fee Shock (25%), Supply (20%), Migration (15%) |
| **Activity Level** | High baseline (mean 4.2 txns/week) | Lower baseline (mean 2.8 txns/week) |
| **Noise & Ambiguity Share** | 10% blended/noisy wallets | **25% blended/noisy wallets** |
| **Holiday & Festival Timing** | Standard 52-week calendar | Shifted festival spikes (Eid / Puja weeks altered) |
| **Channel Switch Probability** | 15% app vs USSD transition rate | 35% app vs USSD transition rate |
| **Decline Slope Variability** | Tightly bounded variance ($\sigma = 0.15$) | High dispersion variance ($\sigma = 0.35$) |

---

## 4. Machine Learning & Feature Engineering Architecture

### 4.1 Feature Extraction Pipeline (`src/model/features.py`)
Rather than consuming raw transaction series directly, WhyQuiet computes **20 normalized mathematical shape features** per wallet. These features prioritize internal ratios over absolute volume, ensuring resilience to lower activity baselines in Population B:

1. `weeks_silent`: Number of weeks since the last recorded transaction.
2. `slope_last8`: Linear regression slope of weekly transaction counts over the final 8 active weeks.
3. `burst_ratio`: Peak weekly transaction volume divided by average weekly volume.
4. `weeks_since_burst`: Time lag in weeks between the peak activity burst and final dormancy.
5. `last4_txn_ratio`: Share of total transaction volume occurring in the final 4 weeks.
6. `ticket_ratio`: Average transaction value in the last 4 weeks relative to lifetime average ticket size.
7. `weeks_since_cashin`: Weeks elapsed since the last cash-in or salary deposit.
8. `cashin_ratio_last4`: Ratio of cash-in count to cash-out count in the final 4 active weeks.
9. `cashout_ok_ratio_last4`: Successful cash-out ratio in the last 4 active weeks.
10. `fail_last6`: Total number of failed transaction attempts in the final 6 weeks.
11. `fail_rate_last6`: Failure rate (failed attempts / total attempts) in the final 6 weeks.
12. `post_fee_ratio`: Ratio of post-fee event transaction frequency to pre-fee frequency.
13. `weeks_after_fee`: Weeks elapsed between a high-fee transaction and wallet dormancy.
14. `weeks_since_district_change`: Weeks since a detected GPS/agent district shift.
15. `app_share_shift`: Change in mobile app usage share vs USSD channel in the final 8 weeks.
16. `payday_concentration`: Proportion of transactions occurring strictly on detected paydays.
17. `active_weeks`: Total count of active transacting weeks across the lifetime.
18. `base_txn_mean`: Average weekly transaction count during the wallet's active lifespan.
19. `pay_cycle`: Encoded pay cycle category (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly).
20. `fade_weeks`: Duration in weeks of gradual transaction fade before complete silence.

*Note: Demographics such as `worker_type` are strictly excluded from model feature inputs to prevent demographic leakage, and are reserved solely for post-hoc subgroup fairness auditing.*

### 4.2 LightGBM Multi-Class Classifier (`src/model/train.py`)
- **Algorithm**: Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (LightGBM 4.7+ multiclass objective).
- **Hyperparameters**: 100 boosting rounds, learning rate 0.05, 15 leaves per tree (no separate depth cap), at least 20 wallets per leaf, balanced class weights.
- **Explainability**: Tree SHAP values computed natively at inference time via LightGBM's `pred_contrib=True`, returning the top 8 signed feature contributions toward the predicted cause.

### 4.3 Calibrated Refusal Engine
A diagnostic tool that never refuses is irresponsible. WhyQuiet implements a two-condition rejection gate:
$$\text{Verdict} = \begin{cases} \text{"refused"} & \text{if } \max_{c} P(c \mid \mathbf{x}) < \tau \quad \lor \quad \left(P_{(1)} - P_{(2)}\right) < \delta \\ \text{"attributed"} & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$
- **Thresholds**: $\tau = 0.80$ (confidence floor), $\delta = 0.10$ (top-2 margin floor), tuned strictly on a 20% validation split of Population A-train (never exposed to Population B).
- **Refusal Explanations**: When refused, the system outputs clear audit rationales:
  - *"Top cause fee_shock 0.45 is below the 0.80 bar (tau)"*
  - *"fee_shock vs solved_problem margin 0.08 is below 0.10 (delta)"*

---

### 4.4 One Wallet, End to End
Wallet `W-N0S673` (domestic worker, monthly pay, silent 5 weeks; population B, never seen in training):
1. **Shape.** Normal activity until week 46, then nothing. In the last six active weeks it logged 5 failed cash-outs.
2. **Features.** `fail_last6 = 5`, `fail_rate_last6 = 0.83` (5 of 6 cash-out attempts failed), plus 18 other ratios against its own baseline.
3. **Posterior.** Supply failure 0.997; every other cause ≤ 0.002.
4. **Refusal test.** 0.997 ≥ τ = 0.80 and the margin 0.995 ≥ δ = 0.10, so the model names a cause.
5. **Why.** Tree SHAP: `fail_last6` +4.94 toward supply failure, far ahead of the next contribution (`app_share_shift` +0.67).
6. **Action and money.** Remedy: agent float alert plus routing SMS, 5 BDT (ASSUMED). The value gate (§7.4) compares the options. At 4% recovery the remedy is worth +9.36 BDT against +3.09 for the blanket SMS, so it sends the remedy. At 1% the remedy loses money (−1.41), so it falls back to the SMS (+0.40).

| **Supply Failure**| 27 | 6 | 12 | 25 | **378** | 448 |

---

### 5.3 Refusal as a Dial, and the Baseline Ladder (`scripts/depth.py`)
The headline counts only the 78.3% of B wallets the model answers, so the full trade-off is reported: answering every wallet gives macro-F1 0.785; answering the most confident 90 / 80 / 70 / 50% gives 0.828 / 0.856 / 0.887 / 0.930. The shipped point is 0.864 with a 95% bootstrap interval of 0.849–0.878.

| Baseline on B | Answers | Macro-F1 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Always guess the most common cause | 100% | 0.082 |
| Hand-written analyst rules (thresholds from A-train medians) | 100% | 0.720 |
| Logistic regression | 100% | 0.785 |
| LightGBM | 100% | 0.785 |
| **LightGBM with calibrated refusal** | 78.3% | **0.864** |

Forced to answer everything, logistic regression ties LightGBM on B. LightGBM's advantage is that it knows which answers are risky: area under the risk-coverage curve 0.080 vs 0.100, and it leads at every refusal level. Holding out one pay cycle at a time within population A, LightGBM wins all three folds (0.928 / 0.934 / 0.915 vs 0.905 / 0.894 / 0.901).

### 5.4 Where It Is Right and Wrong
- **Ambiguity is what gets refused.** Blended (two-cause) wallets: 32.6% refused, 66% accurate when answered. Clean wallets: 17.1% refused, 94% accurate.
- **Per cause (answered F1):** job exit 0.89, migration 0.87, solved problem 0.89, fee shock 0.80, supply failure 0.87. Fee shock is weakest and is refused most (27%).
- **Ablation.** Removing one feature family and retraining hurts the cause it was built for: agent failures → supply failure −27 F1 points; location/channel → migration −25; salary/cash-in → job exit −21; fee/ticket → fee shock −18. Burst and volume features overlap, so removing either alone costs solved problem only 5–6 points.

### 5.5 Calibration Under Shift
Expected calibration error is 0.017 on A-test and 0.100 on B. On B the mean confidence is 88.8% while accuracy is 78.8%; wallets scored about 85% sure are right 67% of the time. Temperature scaling fitted on the A-train validation slice chooses T = 1.05 and only moves B's error to 0.093, so it is not shipped: the miscalibration comes from the shift, not from training. Per-group error on B ranges 0.074 (garment) to 0.123 (retail).

### 5.6 Real-World Readiness: Checks That Need No Labels
- **Accuracy estimate.** Average Thresholded Confidence ([Garg et al., ICLR 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04234)) learns a confidence cut on the A-train validation slice. It estimates 83.2% accuracy on B (true 78.8%, raw confidence 88.8%) and 93.3% on A-test (true 93.4%).
- **Cause mix of the dormant base.** EM prior adjustment ([Saerens et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1162/089976602753284446)) re-estimates cause shares from the posteriors alone. The largest error across the five causes is 2.8 points, against 3.9 for counting top causes and 10.2 for assuming the training mix. The training-frequency prior was chosen over a uniform prior on A-test only (0.008 vs 0.014).
- **Drift alarm.** A classifier separates A from B with AUC 1.00. Per-feature population stability index flags `weeks_after_fee` (1.16), `base_txn_mean` (0.54), `burst_ratio` (0.24) and `pay_cycle` (0.24). The 0.1 / 0.25 bands are a common rule of thumb (UNVERIFIED).

### 5.7 Stress Tests
**Noise dial** (population B parameters with weekly noise σ and blended share raised; 1,500 wallets per level, built in memory):

| Level | Mixed wallets | Macro-F1 answered | Refused | True accuracy | ATC estimate |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| A-like noise | 20% | 0.879 | 20.4% | 79.5% | 83.3% |
| B | 30% | 0.857 | 23.1% | 79.3% | 81.5% |
| B+ | 45% | 0.813 | 26.7% | 73.4% | 79.7% |
| B++ | 60% | 0.733 | 29.6% | 67.2% | 76.8% |

Quality degrades gradually and refusal rises with it. The label-free estimate tracks the direction but stays optimistic at the noisiest level.

**Unseen cause** (population C = B plus 20% `device_loss`, a cause absent from A and B: activity simply stops with no prior decline). The model refuses 41.8% of these wallets against 21.5% of known-cause wallets in the same population, and keeps macro-F1 0.853 on the known causes. The remaining device-loss wallets are labelled fee shock (53%) or job exit (29%). Refusal catches what looks ambiguous, not what looks familiar; in deployment, the drift alarm and the cause-mix estimate are the signals that a new cause has appeared.

## 6. Demographic Parity & Fairness Audit

To verify that WhyQuiet does not exhibit algorithmic bias across demographic and occupational strata, performance was segmented across worker groups and pay cycles in Population B:

### 6.1 Worker Occupation Slices
- **Domestic Workers** ($n=765$): Macro-F1 = **0.8755**, Refusal Rate = **23.79%**
- **Garment Workers** ($n=698$): Macro-F1 = **0.8911**, Refusal Rate = **21.78%**
- **Retail Workers** ($n=554$): Macro-F1 = **0.8493**, Refusal Rate = **17.87%**
- **Transport Workers** ($n=983$): Macro-F1 = **0.8421**, Refusal Rate = **22.28%**

### 6.2 Pay Cycle Slices
- **Weekly Payees** ($n=590$): Macro-F1 = **0.8638**, Refusal Rate = **17.97%**
- **Bi-Weekly Payees** ($n=586$): Macro-F1 = **0.8804**, Refusal Rate = **20.99%**
- **Monthly Payees** ($n=1,824$): Macro-F1 = **0.8560**, Refusal Rate = **23.19%**

*Conclusion: Model accuracy ranges tightly between 0.842 and 0.891 across all worker cohorts. Refusal rates remain proportionate (17.9%–23.8%), ensuring equitable diagnostic quality across vulnerable economic segments.*

## 7. Economic Recovery Modeling & Sensitivity Sweep

### 7.1 Financial Model Specification (`src/rules/money.py`)
Net Economic Value is computed as:
$$\text{Net Value (BDT)} = (\text{Users Recovered} \times \text{ARPU} \times \text{RAMP}) - \text{Total Campaign Cost}$$
Where:
- **ARPU**: 120.0 BDT / month per active user (`# ASSUMED`).
- **RAMP**: 3.0 months average active lifetime value multiplier (`# ASSUMED`).
- **Generic Factor**: Generic messages achieve only 25% of targeted remedy effectiveness (`# ASSUMED`).
- **Generic SMS Cost**: 0.50 BDT / wallet (`# ASSUMED`).
- **Targeted Remedy Costs**: Averaging 11.0 BDT across causes (`job_exit`: 15 BDT, `migration`: 10 BDT, `solved_problem`: 0 BDT, `fee_shock`: 25 BDT, `supply_failure`: 5 BDT) (`# ASSUMED`).

### 7.2 Strategy Comparison Across Recovery Sweep (Population B, $N=3,000$)

| Recovery Rate | Strategy | Actioned Wallets | Recovered Users | Campaign Cost | Net Value (BDT) |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **1% (Pessimistic)** | Rule Baseline | 3,000 | 7.50 | 1,500.00 BDT | **+1,200.00 BDT** |
| | **WhyQuiet Model** | **2,348** | **21.10** | **25,828.00 BDT** | **-18,231.10 BDT** |
| | Oracle (Upper Bound) | 3,000 | 30.00 | 33,000.00 BDT | -22,200.00 BDT |
| **4% (Base Case)** | Rule Baseline | 3,000 | 30.00 | 1,500.00 BDT | **+9,300.00 BDT** |
| | **WhyQuiet Model** | **2,348** | **84.41** | **25,828.00 BDT** | **+4,559.60 BDT** |
| | Oracle (Upper Bound) | 3,000 | 120.00 | 33,000.00 BDT | +10,200.00 BDT |
| **8% (Optimistic)** | Rule Baseline | 3,000 | 60.00 | 1,500.00 BDT | **+20,100.00 BDT** |
| | **WhyQuiet Model** | **2,348** | **168.82** | **25,828.00 BDT** | **+34,947.20 BDT** |
| | Oracle (Upper Bound) | 3,000 | 240.00 | 33,000.00 BDT | +53,400.00 BDT |

### 7.3 Economic Takeaways
- At low recovery rates (1%), the cheap rule baseline preserves positive return (+1,200 BDT) because high-touch remedies exceed incremental revenue.
- At the 4% base case and 8% optimistic case, **targeted remedies recover 2.8&times; more users (84.4 vs 30.0 at 4%; 168.8 vs 60.0 at 8%)**, producing **+34,947 BDT net value** at 8% recovery.
- WhyQuiet's refusal mechanism saved **$7,172\text{ BDT}$** in wasted spend by refusing 652 ambiguous wallets that would otherwise have incurred misallocated remedy costs.

---

### 7.4 Decision-Aware Money: the Value Gate (`src/rules/money.py`)
Sending every attributed wallet its targeted remedy (§7.2) loses to the cheap SMS at 1% and 4%. The value gate decides per wallet: among *skip*, *blanket SMS* and *the cause's targeted remedy*, take the one with the highest expected value, `P(cause) × recovery × ARPU × RAMP − cost`. Refused wallets are always skipped. Two further ASSUMED inputs: each remedy costs its own unit cost (job exit 15, migration 10, fee shock 25, supply failure 5 BDT), and solved-problem wallets do not come back for any message.

| Recovery Rate | Rule (SMS everyone) | Act on every answer | **Value gate** | Oracle (true cause + gate) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1% | +770 BDT | −20,629 BDT | **+728 BDT** | +1,009 BDT |
| 4% | +7,579 BDT | −2,431 BDT | **+8,113 BDT** | +12,175 BDT |
| 8% | +16,658 BDT | +21,833 BDT | **+24,671 BDT** | +38,086 BDT |

With the gate, WhyQuiet beats the rule at 4% and 8% and ties it at 1% (−42 BDT). At 4% the gate sends 1,184 SMS, 307 agent-map referrals and 422 float alerts, and skips 1,087 wallets (refused or likely solved). The gate uses the model's posterior, which is overconfident on B (§5.5), so these values lean optimistic.

### 7.5 Pilot Design
Randomize triaged wallets within each predicted cause into *targeted remedy* vs *blanket SMS* for 8 weeks. With the ASSUMED 4% targeted vs 1% generic recovery, a two-sided test at α = 0.05 with power 0.8 needs 424 wallets per arm (about 4,240 for a per-cause read-out); if the true lift is only 1% → 2%, it needs 2,319 per arm. The label-free checks in §5.6 run on the pilot ledger from day one. Go/no-go is the measured net value of the value-gated arm against the SMS arm.

## 8. Governance, Security & Responsible AI Architecture

### 8.1 Two-Person Maker-Checker Rule
To prevent unauthorized mass communications or budget misallocation:
1. **Analyst Role**: Authorized to query the triage queue and submit proposed batches (`POST /api/batches`).
2. **Approver Role**: Authorized to review pending batches, examine eligible wallet IDs and costs, and approve/reject (`POST /api/batches/{id}/approve`).
3. **Database-Level Barrier**: PostgreSQL CHECK constraint `remedy_batches_two_person (decided_by <> proposed_by)` and trigger `guard_batch_wallets` ensure that self-approval is rejected at the database level even if application-level checks fail.

### 8.2 Immutable Audit Trail
All governance events are logged to `public.audit_log`:
- Rows contain `actor_id`, `actor_role`, `action`, `target_id`, `metadata`, and `created_at`.
- Triggers `audit_log_no_update_delete` and `audit_log_no_truncate` block all `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `TRUNCATE` operations, establishing a legally verifiable, immutable compliance ledger.

### 8.3 Zero-PII Guarantee
WhyQuiet operates entirely on pseudonymous IDs formatted as `W-[0-9A-Z]{6}`. No MSISDNs, NID numbers, biometric identifiers, or geographic addresses are stored or processed.

## 9. Conclusion & Limitations

WhyQuiet demonstrates that MFS dormancy is solvable not through heavier mass-marketing, but through **causal diagnostics, refusal discipline, and responsible governance**.

### Acknowledged Limitations:
1. **Simulated Environment**: All experiments use synthetically modeled transaction mechanics. Real-world validation with upay ledger data is required to confirm actual cause priors.
2. **Inter-MFS Blind Spot**: In a single-operator ledger, the model cannot distinguish between a customer churning to a competitor (e.g. bKash/Nagad) versus general economic dormancy.
3. **Overconfidence Under Shift and Unseen Causes**: Calibration error rises from 0.017 to 0.100 under shift, and a cause absent from training is refused only 42% of the time. The label-free accuracy estimate and drift alarm flag both conditions; neither replaces a labelled pilot.
4. **Assumed Economic Constants**: Financial rates (ARPU 120 BDT, RAMP 3.0) are unverified industry estimates and must be calibrated against actual institutional P&L data.
