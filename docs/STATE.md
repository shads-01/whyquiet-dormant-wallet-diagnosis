# STATE — WhyQuiet (Dormant-wallet diagnosis)

Update at session start and before ending every session (AGENTS.md "Read first").

## Current hour
1

## Deployment & Resources
- **GitHub Repo (Public)**: https://github.com/shads-01/whyquiet-dormant-wallet-diagnosis
- **Production URL**: https://whyquiet.vercel.app
- **Supabase Project Ref**: `grflsfhkcatoxpjeszxh` (region: ap-southeast-1 Singapore, org "hrittikaaa's Org"; fresh deploy D37, replaces `tbvbvvyykozmpbcyrbqw`)

## Tooling
| Service | Available Via | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub | CLI (`gh`) | Authenticated as `shads-01` |
| Vercel | CLI (`vercel`, logged in as `hrittikaaa`) | Linked project `whyquiet` under hrittikaaa's projects (D37); deploys from the CLI, no Git integration |
| Supabase | CLI (`npx supabase`, linked) | Project `grflsfhkcatoxpjeszxh` under Hrittika's org (D37) |
| Context7 | MCP (`context7`) | Resolves and queries official library documentation |

## Window assumption
8 hours (D18 locked: full project build across Shads, Hrittika, Arko)

## Tier 0 checklist (done by hour 24 — AMENDMENTS A7)
- [x] Generator with populations A and B
- [x] Rule baseline (`src/rules/baseline.py`; per wallet and as F1 in `seed.json`)
- [x] Trained model with SHAP-style reasons (LightGBM `pred_contrib`, D27)
- [x] Refusal path (model `decide` with reasons; refusal screen renders real refusals from `seed.json`)
- [x] Money report with the 1% / 4% / 8% recovery sweep (`seed.json` report.money, Evidence page)
- [x] Console UI (Cause Desk delivered: Queue, Wallet Detail, Refusal, Evidence, Batches)
- [x] Deployed demo URL that works offline from seeded data (Vercel production active)
- [x] README with every section required by CONTEXT_v3 section 9
- [x] Report draft (`docs/report.md`)
- [x] Consent/compliance block
- [x] Minimal fairness check (macro-F1 and refusal rate per worker type and per pay cycle; `seed.json` report.fairness)
- [x] Other mandatory deliverables named in CONTEXT_v3 section 9 (public GitHub repo with continuous commit history; live deployment reachable by judges)

## Done
- Project scaffolded with official generator & locked stack: Python 3.12/uv, FastAPI + Pydantic v2, Vite + React + TS + Tailwind, types generated from OpenAPI contract
- Public GitHub repo created: `whyquiet-dormant-wallet-diagnosis` with clean secret scan and CI (check + e2e) green
- Fresh deploy (D37, 2026-10-04): Supabase project `whyquiet` (`grflsfhkcatoxpjeszxh`, Free, Singapore) with both migrations applied and both demo accounts; Vercel project `whyquiet` (hrittikaaa's projects) at https://whyquiet.vercel.app, `verify_deploy.py` PASS, full write-path flow checked against the new DB.
- Vercel production deployment live with serverless Python API and Vite web app
- Context files standardized to uniform format: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, OPENCODE.md, opencode.json, .agents/rules/00-project.md
- System design finalized & approved in `docs/system-design.md` with radical ponytail simplification (Tier 0 vs Tier 1, public offline read screens, 2-person batch approval, campaign download, zero PII, D11–D14).
- Detailed 8h parallel team execution plans & contracts created in `docs/plans/` (shads.md, hrittika.md, arko.md) and `docs/contracts/` (seed-bundle.md, api.md).
- Datagen: populations A (4800 train / 1200 test) and B (3000) via `uv run python -m datagen.generate --seed 42` (design: D21).
- Model (Hrittika Task 2): `src/model/features.py` (20 shape features) and `src/model/train.py` (LightGBM + calibrated refusal, tau/delta tuned on an A-train validation slice), D27/D28. H4 gate passed on a first check: B macro-F1 about 0.86 on attributed wallets vs rule baseline 0.08; refusal about 9% on A-test and 22% on B. Official numbers come from Task 3.
- Evaluation (Hrittika Task 3): `uv run python scripts/evaluate.py --seed 42` (D29). Seed 42: B macro-F1 0.864 (attributed), A-test 0.962, gap 0.098, refusal 9.3% A-test / 21.7% B, ECE on B 0.100, shuffled-label control 0.162, best single feature `cashin_ratio_last4` 0.373, rule baseline 0.082. Fairness on B: macro-F1 0.84-0.89 and refusal 18-24% across worker types and pay cycles.
- Seed export (Hrittika Task 4): `uv run python scripts/export_seed.py --seed 42` writes `web/public/seed.json` (400 B wallets, 100 refused, 0.9 MB; D30). UI now runs on real data. Money with the ASSUMED constants in `src/rules/money.py` & `src/rules/routing.py`: price-aware routed strategy matches blanket rule like-for-like at 1% and outperforms it at 4% (৳10,125 vs ৳9,300, +8.9%) and 8% (৳28,999 vs ৳20,100, +44.3%).
- Seed check (Hrittika Task 5, D33): seeds 1, 2, 3 give B macro-F1 mean 0.868, range 0.847-0.886; refusal 8.3-13.3% A-test vs 18.2-27.7% B (B above A on every seed); shuffled control 0.196-0.233; best single feature 0.363-0.382 (`ticket_ratio` on all three). Seed 42 re-run matches `seed.json` exactly, so no re-export.
- Frontend (Shads Tasks 0–4): Complete Cause Desk delivered with Claymorphic + Neumorphic dark/light UI, Triage Queue, 26-week decline shape & posterior charts, Refusal screen with refusal proof, Evidence & ML rigor page with confusion matrix & fairness table, Batches & Governance with 2-role auth, 2-person approval, and campaign export.
- Backend & Rules (Arko Tasks 1–7): Write-path API endpoints with Pydantic v2 schemas, deterministic rules (`baseline.py`, `remedies.py`, `money.py`), Supabase migration (`20261003215000_remedy_batches.sql`) with maker-checker triggers and immutable audit log, real Supabase auth & batch endpoints, 88 unit/integration tests, 27 e2e tests, comprehensive README and evaluation report.

## Status: All Tasks 1–7 + Hardening Items 1–6 Complete across all 3 team members
- All deliverables verified with `make check` (114 backend tests passed, 0 pyright errors, 0 ruff errors) and `make e2e` (41/41 Playwright e2e tests passed including axe-core WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility).
- Write-path hardening deployed: 30-day wallet cooldown on re-proposing approved campaigns, 5-open-batch analyst cap, batch list pagination & status filters, authenticated campaign export with 503-only offline sample fallback, global 401 session expiration handling with re-login prompt, and immutable audit history timeline.

## Open items
- LICENSE choice (none yet — deliberately unlicensed until decided)
- Hobby-plan terms check (Supabase free tier pauses after 7 days inactivity; re-check before demo day)
- Ignored private docs confirmed: `docs/v2/`, `docs/v3/*.md` (except PROJECT.md, STATE.md, DECISIONS.md), `docs/01-*/`, `docs/02-*/`, `docs/archive/`, `spikes/`, `IDEA_POOL.md`, `CONTEXT*.md`, `*.pdf`, `*.docx`

## Blockers
